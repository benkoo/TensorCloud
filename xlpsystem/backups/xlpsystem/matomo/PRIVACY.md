# Privacy 
This is a summary of all of the components within Piwik which may affect your privacy in some way. Please keep in mind
third party Themes, Plugins or Apps may introduce privacy concerns not listed here.

## Privacy for users being tracked by Piwik
In this section we document how to protect the privacy of visitors who are tracked by your Piwik analytics service.

### Anonymise visitor IP addresses
By default, Piwik stores the visitor IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 format) in the database for each new visitor. 
If a visitor has a static IP address this means her browsing history can be easily identified across several days and
even across several websites tracked within the same Piwik server. You can anonymize IP addresses to ensure visitors cannot
be tracked this way: [How to anonymise IP addresses.](https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/#step-1-automatically-anonymize-visitor-ips)

### Delete old visitors logs
By default, Piwik stores tracked data forever. To better respect the privacy of your users, it is recommended to regularly
purge old data. You can configure Piwik to automatically delete log data older than a specified number of months: 
[How to delete old visitors log data.](https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/#step-2-delete-old-visitors-logs)

### Include a tracking Opt-Out feature on your site
In your website, we recommended providing an easy way for your visitors to “opt-out” of being tracked by Piwik. 
You can use the Opt-Out feature to display a link your website that sets a special browser cookie (`piwik_ignore`) when
clicked. Visitors that click that link will be ignored by Piwik in the future:

### Respect DoNotTrack preference
Do Not Track is a browser-level technology and policy proposal that lets visitors opt out of tracking by websites they
do not visit. Visitors can enable this preference in their browser, and then it's up to Piwik to respect it. By default,
Piwik is configured to ignore visitors that have enabled it:

### Disable tracking cookies
A cookie is a collection of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer and accesses each time the visitor
returns. By default, Piwik uses cookies to aid in tracking visitor behavior. If someone gains access to a visitor's
computer, they could learn a few things about how the visitor visited your website. For many websites, this isn't a
problem, but for others where a strong level of privacy is required (like online banking), disabling tracking cookies may
be a good idea: [How to disable tracking cookies.](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_157/)

### Keep your visitors details private
Any user that has at least `view` access (the default access level) to Piwik can view detailed information for all users
tracked in Piwik (such as their IP addresses, visitor IDs, details of all past visits and actions, etc.) through features
provided by the `Live` plugin (such as the Visitor Log and Visitor Profile). As the Piwik administrator, you may decide
that not all of your users need access to this data. You can deactivate the `Live` plugin to prevent users from viewing
visitor details in the Administration > Plugins page.

## Privacy for Piwik admins and website owners
In this section we document how a Piwik administrator can better protect their own privacy.

### Keep your Piwik server URL private
By default, the Piwik Javascript code on all tracked websites contains the Piwik server URL. In some cases you might
want to hide this Piwik URL completely while still tracking all websites in your Piwik instance. To hide your Piwik
server's URL, you can modify the Javascript Tracking code and point it to a proxy piwik.php script instead of your actual
Piwik server: [How to keep Piwik server URL private.](https://matomo.org/faq/how-to/faq_132/)

### Automatic update check
From time to time, Piwik uses `api.piwik.org` to check if the current version of Piwik is the latest version of Piwik.
If an update is available, a notification is displayed allowing you to upgrade Piwik. To disable the update check,
and stop your instance from sending HTTP requests to `api.piwik.org`, deactivate the "Automatic update" feature by
setting `enable_auto_update = 0` in your configuration file `config/config.ini.php`.
