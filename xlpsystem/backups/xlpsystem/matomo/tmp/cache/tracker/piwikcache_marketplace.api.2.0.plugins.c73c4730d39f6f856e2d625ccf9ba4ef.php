<p>Hi, this is Mike from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>, the company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used 
by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</p>

<p>I\'m very proud to introduce you to our Heatmap &amp; Session Recording feature which lets you analyze your visitors\' behaviour
on a whole new level that was not possible before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means it can increase your conversion rates and sales big times without much effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Heatmaps</strong> show you where on a page your visitors tried to click, where they moved the mouse and how far down they scrolled. This lets you find out to what your visitors really pay attention to, what they are looking for, how engaging your content is, whether
your content encourages users to scroll, whether key content is positioned correctly, whether they get distracted by something unimportant, whether your visitors think that something is clickable even though it is not, and much more. You can view heatmaps for different device types and compare how your content works across devices.</p>

<p><strong>Session Recordings</strong> lets you record activities such as clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, window resizes, form interactions, and changes in your page. You can then replay these activities in a video and see exactly what a visitor did on your website. It is like eye-tracking but much more cost effective, takes only seconds to setup, and you actually get insights into your real visitors instead of a test group. It is ideal to improve the usability of your website, to see how your visitors experience your website, where they have problems, and why they leave. A great use case is for example watching your visitors fill out forms and perfectly complements our <a href="https://www.form-analytics.net">Form Analytics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you have Heatmap &amp; Session Recording, you will see what your visitors see and do when they visit your website and ultimately truly understand them. Based on the insights you get, you will identify problems, make changes, and see if these changes actually improve your website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hi, this is David from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>, the company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used 
by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</p>

<p>At InnoCraft, we know that all businesses and organizations have different goals and needs. It is therefore important to
get the insights you need in order to achieve your goals and improve your websites and apps. While Matomo comes with a great set of standard reports, you can often not get all the information you need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the past, this meant you could either not get the information you wanted, or you had to create the report manually in a spreadsheet which takes hours and is error-prone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where Custom Reports rocks. It takes this cumbersome work away by allowing you to create a new report in only seconds. You can choose from over 200 different dimensions and metrics to get the insights
 you need. You can further customize the report by choosing between different
 visualizations, and even define report filters (view a report only for a subset of your visitors, like a segment).</p>

<p>Wondering what some examples could be? For example, you could drill down any dimension by hour or even minute. Wondering at which minute of the day your pages are generated the slowest? You are only a few clicks away from finding it out. Because you can select multiple dimensions, you can also build new reports over three levels such as "Events Category, Event Name, and Event Action" where Matomo only supports two levels. You can also get lots of valuable information by drilling down reports by user (for example see which Page URLs each user has viewed), by country, by device type, and much more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Custom Reports supports even some dimensions and metrics that are not available in Matomo yet! And if you are missing some dimensions or metrics, we are likely able to add them for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<ul><li>Gain amazing new insights that weren\'t possible before directly in your Matomo</li>
<li>Be able to deliver the information you need on time with ease</li>
<li>Save time and reduce the risk of human error by automating report generation and avoiding manual reporting processing (for example in Excel) </li>
<li>Make decisions faster and more reliable</li>
<li>See all reports you need at a glance and compare reports more easily without having to click around</li>
<li>Supports <a href="https://plugins.matomo.org/RollUpReporting">Roll-Up Reporting</a> which lets you create custom reports across several or all of your websites</li>
<li>100% data ownership</li>
</ul><h3>Our promise</h3>

<p><a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/"><img src="https://shop.matomo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/money_back-300x294.png" style="width:220px;float:right;margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Our promise to you" /></a>It is hard to explain all the possible new insights and benefits you can get out of Custom Reports as there are so many! Matomo tracks a lot of data and it is simply amazing to see which new conclusions you can suddenly draw when you look at all this data in a new, much more advanced way. There are literally millions of report combinations possible and only the sky will be your limit when you have Custom Reports. Another benefit of Custom Reports is that it supports even more features than most of the standard reports in Matomo. For example, you can pivot any custom report. Hand-crafted by the makers of Matomo, we are certain once you start using it, you will be thrilled by the power of Custom Reports.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why we give you a <a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/">100% unconditional, easy, fast, and hassle-free money back guarantee</a> for 30 days. There are no strings attached.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravar</a> means Globally Recognized Avatar. When enabled, it will try to find a matching
avatar image for your users so you can easily see which user has performed which activity. An avatar image may be 
shown next to an activity in the activity log. This feature is not enabled by default as our plugins 
do not send any of your data or metadata to external web services for <a href="https://matomo.org/privacy">privacy</a> compliance.</p>

<p>To enable Gravatar images, log in to Matomo as a <a href="https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_35/">Super User</a> and go to 
"Administration =&gt; Plugin Settings", where you can enable the Gravatar setting.</p>

<p><strong>As a developer, how do I log activities done within my custom plugin?</strong></p>

<p>To log custom activities happening in your custom plugin, you can define Activity classes (extending <code>Piwik\\Plugins\\ActivityLog\\Activity\\Activity</code>). 
You need to place these classes in a directory named <code>Activity</code> within any plugin. The Audit log will then include all
 such activities recorded by your plugin.</p>

<p><strong>How can I export the Activity Log UI to embed it somewhere else?</strong></p>

<p>First you need to log in to your Matomo. Then click on "Personal" in the top right corner and click on "Widgets"
in the left menu. There you can find the widget "Activity Log" in the "Diagnostic" section. Below the widget the URL
to export it is shown. To learn more about this, read the <a href="https://matomo.org/docs/embed-piwik-report/">Embed Matomo Widget</a> user guide.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Tom from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>, the company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used

It lets you know how often a form was viewed, started, submitted, re-submitted, and converted.

<p><em>Hi, this is Tom from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>. The company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</em></p>

<p><em>For years we had those discussions within our team and with the bosses about which solution would convert better than another. Sometimes they would be on a Monday morning even before the first coffee or on a Friday afternoon just before the weekend: “Let’s go with a red color here”, “No, I’m sure blue will work much better” and a third person comes in “I’m sure a lighter blue color is better”.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Truth is, you never know what really works the best unless you test it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Have you had similar situations? Do you want to consistently increase your conversions and revenue? Then we have built just the right thing for you and we are sure it will end your discussions too and help you grow your business. When you create an A/B Test, you compare different wordings, looks, layouts or entirely different pages with each other and you get scientifically proven results which version works better. No longer any guessing when you build your app or website.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take the guesswork out of your website optimization and reduce the risk in all your decision making.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Unsurprisingly - <a href="https://www.ab-tests.net">A/B Testing</a> is one of the most requested feature for Matomo and since we built and started using it, it really made a difference and changed the way we work, think and make our decisions. Shall we use “Buy now” or “Subscribe now”? Which background or product image works better? Now we simply try different versions, test them and keep the best working solution that actually increases our conversions. We even review previously made decisions and we got some shocking results: we were sometimes very wrong about what converts best. Did you know that in some tests changing a button color from green to red increased clicks by over 20%? I’d be curious to hear about your remarkable changes once you start testing.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start testing and improving everything from aesthetics like content and colors to back-end functionality. Even small changes can have a huge impact in your conversions and revenue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A/B Testing is built on top of Matomo which means you get all those benefits and features from Matomo on top. Like data ownership, no data limits, being able to host it yourself on premise and use it in the intranet etc. That’s why Matomo is so popular among businesses, corporations and governments. Matomo is used and trusted by over a million websites and apps.</em></p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>When you have the <a href="https://www.ab-tests.net">A/B Testing plugin</a>, it lets you easily create experiments and compare different versions of your website or app and it will automatically detect which variation increases your revenue or conversions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Experimenting and measuring the effect of each change you make with A/B testing gives you the confidence to always make changes which increase your revenue and conversions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="//www.ab-tests.net/innocraft/abcomparison.png" style="width:400px;float:right;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:10px;margin-top:10px;" alt="abcomparison.png" />A/B tests are also known as experiments or split tests. In an A/B test you show two or more different variations to your 
users (visitors) and the variation that performs better wins. When a user enters the experiment, a variation will be 
randomly chosen and the user will see this variation for all subsequent visits. Matomo A/B testing uses 
advanced statistical analysis to detect which variation performs better for your conversion goals and success metrics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ultimately you can eliminate the guess work in your decision making and maximise your success!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Our promise</h3>

<p><a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/"><img src="https://shop.matomo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/money_back-300x294.png" style="width:220px;float:right;margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Our promise to you" /></a>A/B Testing is simple to use, even if you have never created an A/B test before. It is hand-crafted by the makers of Matomo with top quality and we are convinced once you start using it, you will never want to miss it again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why we give you a <a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/">100% unconditional, easy, fast, and hassle-free money back guarantee</a> for 30 days. There are no strings attached.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have had many delighted users that increased their revenue by more than the cost for this plugin with just one test. We have even had users that shared with us how they enjoy the moment when they tell their boss he or she was wrong because a test has proven his or her suggestion converts worse. So try it now and let us know how you do. We are happy to help you get started and to hear your story how it changes your life.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Matt from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com/">InnoCraft</a>. The company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</p>

<p>At InnoCraft, we run the Matomo project and the community. We are therefore responsible for many different websites: Our matomo.org website, the Matomo Marketplace, the Matomo Developer Zone, the Matomo Forum, 
and some more. When you run several websites, mobile apps, or sub-domains like we do, you want to understand the overall 
performance of your business while still being able to compare the performance of your individual websites and apps. Roll-Up Reporting is for you and will provide huge value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you have Roll-Up Reporting, it lets you aggregate data from multiple websites and apps into one single site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.innocraft.com/innocraft/rollUpReporting.png" style="width:320px;float:right;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:5px;" alt="Roll-Up Reporting" />This lets you answer questions like 
"How many visits happened on all of my websites and apps?" and "Which campaigns contributed the most across several of my websites?" 
or "How do my various Brands overall compare with each other?"
When you have several shops (eg white-labels) it is very valuable to see how your ecommerce shops are performing overall. 
Or when you are a web agency and you are serving many customers and want to provide each customer with a single aggregate view of all their web properties.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Roll-Up Reporting lets you analyze this aggregated data in one site so easily. It saves you lots of time and helps you gain the insights you need instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets say you have separate websites for different countries (your-business.com, your-business.fr, your-business.de, etc). They are separate sites in your Matomo but you might still want to see a combined report on all of them. 
Roll-Up Reporting gathers the data of these websites into one single site and allows you to see aggregated metrics and reports for those sites.
You can still access each website individually as you are used to, and the Roll-Up site will allow you to analyze the aggregated data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we used Roll-Up Reporting, we couldn\'t get a detailed view of our overall web activity for our work on the Matomo project. Now that we have setup Roll-Up Reporting (which took less than five minutes), we know exactly the most popular content across all sub-domains and websites, we can easily optimise our marketing budget across all our web properties, and it\'s so much easier to monitor overall growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Hi, this is Stefan from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>. The company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</em></p>

<p><em>Some years ago most search engines decided to hide keywords from the referrer urls, which made it impossible for web analytics tools to report reliable keyword statistics. Tools like Matomo started reporting keyword searches as "Keyword not defined" or "Keyword not provided".</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ever wondered how to get better insights on those hidden keywords?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>With our Search Engine Keywords Performance plugin, you will get back deep insights about all the keywords that people are searching for when clicking on your websites. All of your keywords directly into your familiar Matomo Analytics reports. The biggest search engines are providing tools and APIs that allow us, website owners, to get the list of our keywords along with the critical metrics Impressions, Clicks, ClickThrough ratio and Average position in the Search results page. This plugin makes it easy for you to connect to the APIs and will automatically import your valuable keyword data into Matomo Referrers reports.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop being in the dark about this incredible keyword searches information and know what your users and customers are searching for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Which queries caused your website to appear in search results? Stop wasting time by looking up keyword statistics in serveral Webmaster Tools and start getting combined results across all supported search engines within Matomo. Which queries result in more traffic to your website than others? Improve your SEO efforts and monitor your position and performance for each Keyword directly in your Matomo reports.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a bonus you will also get a new "Crawling overview" report which reports all the most important information about how Search Engines robots crawl your websites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Was there any server errors or connection timeout? How many pages of my websites were crawled and indexed? How many page not found errors? How many total inbound links were found pointing to my website? Keep an eye on these search crawling metrics metrics directly within Matomo. Do not miss important errors and maximise your SEO power to get more traffic!</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eliminate "not found" pages that give your visitors a bad experience and lose less visitors on your website</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Have you ever been stuck on a so called "404 not found" page? What are the chances that you continue browsing on this website or the chance that you find the page you were looking for afterwards? The page crawling errors reports gives you a list of all pages that could not be crawled by a search engine with a detailed reason. This helps you to take the right actions to improve the experience on your website. For the Google search engine you will also be able to see all inbound links for such pages. Use this information to easily update links to your pages which are incorrect.</em></p>

<h3>How Search Keywords Performance monitor works</h3>

<p>Google and other bigger search engines provide webmaster tools that allow website owners to access various statistics about their websites.</p>

<p>In Matomo you will be guided to set up access to these APIs - it just takes a few minutes. Matomo will then automatically start importing your keyword statistics every day.</p>

<p>In most webmaster tools you will even get some access to your historical keyword data. For example Google lets you view keyword statistics for the past three months. And when you use Search Engine Keywords Performance, the beauty is that you will keep a full copy of your valuable keyword data within Matomo and this data will be stored there forever. So you will be able to view the evolution of your keywords metrics and KPIs over many months and years and over time compare how your search analytics keywords evolve. Monitoring SEO has never been so easy! Matomo lets you once again keep full control of your data and gain more insights.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Tom from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>. The company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</p>

<p><a href="#preview"><img src="https://www.innocraft.com/innocraft/usersFlow.png" style="width:320px;float:right;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:5px;" alt="usersFlow.png" /></a>Do you know how your visitors navigate through your website or app? Do you understand your users needs? Do you know what they are trying to accomplish and what is important to them? Do you know how to improve your user flow? Well, we thought we did, but it turned out we didn\'t until
we actually were able to visualize those paths over several steps in an easy to understand graph. We were really surprised by some paths our users took every day. We discovered new popular pages where we totally under-estimated the importance of them, 
we found that many users actually had a problem on our home page so they had to reload it and we improved some popular 
paths we didn\'t expect users were going. Now these paths are much more straight-forward for our users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Users Flow visualization is a representation of the most popular paths your users took through your website or app. At a glance, you see how your users navigate through your website over several steps, where they exit and it lets you dig into this data by exploring all traffic that went through a certain page and more. Users Flow also provides some additional reports to get the information you need even quicker, for example with the Top Paths report showing you all the most popular paths in a simple to read table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Multiplying the value of Users Flow with segments</strong> We looked very carefully into how different kind of visitors use our websites, especially visitors that enter our website for the first time, by applying segments. This allowed us, and it will allow you as well, to engineer the process that each potential customer or visitor goes through and optimize it to improve your conversion rates and revenue. Being able to filter the Users Flow reports to a particular user segment is so valuable for us (for example filtering by the visitors that converted a specific goal) and we are still fascinated how the flow evolves when we make changes to our website based on the Users Flow reports.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you send traffic to your website, you need to know the first page your potential customers will hit, and the second page they hit and where they exit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<ul><li>Understand a customers path to conversion or purchase.</li>
<li>Learn all about your users needs, what they are trying to accomplish, and what is important to them</li>
<li>Apply segments to see for example the paths your users took when they converted a goal, or when they didn\'t. See how users navigate through your website for different referrers and more.</li>
<li>See if your call to actions work and whether users are actually following the path you had in mind. You may discover users 
are taking different paths which can indicate that visitors are not finding what they want.</li>
<li>Investigate whether a redesigned page might confuse your visitors or changes the path your visitors take.</li>
<li>Discover high drop-offs on pages.</li>
<li>Find bugs on your website by exploring unexpected high exits and unexpected paths. </li>
</ul><h3>Our promise</h3>

<p><a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/"><img src="https://shop.matomo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/money_back-300x294.png" style="width:220px;float:right;margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Our promise to you" /></a>Users Flow is built on top of Matomo which means you get all those benefits and features from Matomo on top. Like data ownership, no data limits, being able to host it yourself on premise and use it in the intranet etc. That’s why Matomo is so popular among businesses, corporations and governments. Hand-crafted by the makers of Matomo, we are convinced you will be surprised about its value once you start using Users Flow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why we give you a <a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/">100% unconditional, easy, fast, and hassle-free money back guarantee</a> for 30 days. There are no strings attached.</p>

<p>So try it now and let us know how you do. We are happy to help you get started and are looking forward to hear about your discovered surprises.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Mike from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>, the company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used 
by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</p>

<p>When you acquire visitors, one of the most challenging question is to know on which channels to spend your money
 and how much. One of the most important sources for this kind of information is to measure which channels or referrers
 are the most successful and lead the most to your goal conversions and Ecommerce sales compared to your spending.</p>

<p>The problem is that most analytics tools, including Matomo, only show you the channels for the last non-direct visits. However, in reality, multiple channels contribute to a conversion as a visitor often visits a website several times from different channels before they convert a goal. This means having only a look at the last visit doesn\'t give you an accurate representation of the most successful channels.</p>

<p>The Multi Channel Conversion Attribution gives you a better understanding of your media spending by letting you apply 
different attribution models to find out which channels really lead to a conversion or purchase. You can compare the 
different models next to each other and see how you need to shift your spending from one channel, ad, or campaign to another.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<ul><li>Identify valuable referrers that you did not see before</li>
<li>No longer falsely over-estimate any referrer or marketing channel</li>
<li>Make better decisions on how to shift your marketing spending to increase your profit</li>
<li>Gain more visitors by focussing on the channels that actually contribute the most to your conversions and revenue</li>
<li>Optimize your ad-spending and improve its efficiency</li>
<li>Better understand your visitors journey</li>
<li>Get a clearer view of the entire acquisition process from beginning to the end</li>
<li>100% data ownership</li>
</ul><h3>Our promise</h3>

<p><a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/"><img src="https://shop.matomo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/money_back-300x294.png" style="width:220px;float:right;margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Our promise to you" /></a>We are certain once you start using it, you will love getting a better understanding of your marketing spending and website content.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why we give you a <a href="https://shop.matomo.org/refund-policy/">100% unconditional, easy, fast, and hassle-free money back guarantee</a> for 30 days. There are no strings attached.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Now we are getting much more insights into our funnels and it is a lot easier to use. Funnels helps us to increase our conversation rates just perfectly and we even save money with it. Thank you."</p></blockquote>


<p>Hi, this is Tom from <a href="https://www.innocraft.com">InnoCraft</a>. The company of the makers of Matomo Analytics which is used by over 1 million websites and apps in over 150 countries.</p>

<p>No matter what type of website or app you have, whether you are trying to get your users to sign up for something or sell products, there is a certain number of steps your visitors have to go through. I bet the same applies to you.</p>

<p><a href="#preview"><img src="https://www.innocraft.com/innocraft/funnels.png" style="width:320px;float:right;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:5px;" alt="usersFlow.png" /></a>Have you ever wondered if your visitors or users actually follow that path in your website or app? And wondered where you lose your visitors? Where they maybe get confused? Want to see when something is not working anymore? Maybe you have a multi step signup form or onboarding process? On every step you lose visitors and therefore potential revenue and conversions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s critical to know how well your visitors go through these steps, where they originally came from and where they go to when they drop off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are wondering about such things like we do, or want to drive your conversions and sales, we have something for you. Funnels visualizes the steps your users take to complete a goal or purchase to instantly see how well they succeed or fail at each step. When you have it, you can evaluate your success and improve your website or app to boost your conversion rates (CRO) and sales based on the information it provides. In one of our funnels we once noticed users often left our website because of unimportant links that were shown too eye-catching and suddenly we increased conversion rates by 10%, simply by removing a few links.</p>

<h3>Funnels helps you to increase your conversions, sales and revenue with your existing traffic by</h3>

<ul><li>finding out where your visitors have problems</li>
<li>finding out where they don\'t understand the flow of your website</li>
<li>finding out where a bug on your website or app occurs</li>
<li>finding other problems that get in the way of converting your goals</li>
</ul><h3>Get ultimate insights into your funnels with these unique features</h3>

<ul><li>See at a glance how your funnels are converting in the funnels overview page</li>
<li>See how changes you make on your website is affecting user behavior and funnel conversions over time </li>

<li>See how segments of your audience flow through your marketing funnel and optimise your flow for these specific segments of users</li>
</ul><h3>Our promise</h3>

<p>This Matomo authentication plugin allows users to log in to Matomo using SAML Identity Provider (IdP).</p>

<li>Tracks only orders that actually complete and ignores for example failed orders (if the status changes later, the plugin will recognize this and correctly track it)</li>
<li>Fully compatible with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-piwik/">WP-Piwik/WP-Matomo</a> (recommended) or use WooCommerce Analytics on its own to get your Ecommerce Analytics</li>

              'faq' => '<p><strong>Which WooCommerce versions are supported?</strong></p>

<p>WooCommerce 2 and WooCommerce 3 are supported.</p>

<p><strong>Which WordPress versions are supported?</strong></p>

<p>The plugin has been tested with WordPress 4.5 and higher. It also supports WordPress 5.X.</p>

<p><strong>Does the plugin support product variations / variables?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, product variations are supported.</p>

<p><strong>Does the plugin support WooCommerce Subscriptions?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the WooCommerce Subscription plugin is supported and renewals are tracked as well.</p>

<p><strong>How is this plugin different to other WooCommerce Matomo / Piwik plugins?</strong></p>

<p>Other plugins don\'t really work at all, and if they work they don\'t track the data correctly.</p>

<p>As we are using WooCommerce ourselves on the matomo.org Marketplace we can ensure it works very well, is stable and it doesn\'t have any known security issues.</p>

<p>This plugin tracks the data in a special way to ensure very accurate tracking of cart updates and orders that you won\'t get anywhere else. This allows you for example to much better find out where your users abandon your cart. As the creators of Matomo, we can also ensure that the data is tracked correctly.</p>

<p>Another benefit of our solution is, that it tracks orders and cart updates even if a user is using an ad-blocker. In this case you might not see any page views, but still be able to analyze all ecommerce related information.</p>

<p><strong>Do I still need a plugin to track regular page views, events, etc?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you will still need a plugin do track regular pageviews, outlinks, downloads and more. We recommend to use our WooCommerce plugin in combination with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-piwik/">WP-Matomo/WP-Piwik</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How do I install and update the plugin on WooCommerce?</strong></p>

<p>Once you have installed this plugin on your Matomo, go to "Administration" and then "WooCommerce" in Matomo. There you will find straight forward installation instructions and the download of the WooCommerce plugin.</p>

<p>You will be able to update the WooCommerce plugin with just one click.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any known issues?</strong></p>

<p>It currently may create once a new visitor as soon as a cart is updated. If this is the case, all following pageviews and actions will be tracked into the newly created visitor. This happens only when for example a user visited your shop in the past, deletes all the cookies and then visits your shop again. It may also happen when opening the website in an "Igncognito window" in your browser. We will be solving this issue in Matomo itself.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other requirements?</strong></p>

<p>The WooCommerce server needs to be able to ping (via HTTP/S) your Matomo installation in order to track orders and cart updates.</p>

<p>If you don\'t know what that means, you very likely don\'t need to worry about it and it will just work.</p>

<p><strong>Where do I find the logs of the WooCommerce plugin?</strong></p>
